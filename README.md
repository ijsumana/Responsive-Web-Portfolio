# Responsive-Web-Portfolio
# Folder Structure
The project is completed to showcase my recent projects of Full Stack Web Development Nano Degree in Udacty.com. I have created a responsive
web page using CSS3, HTML5, and Bootstrap grid layout. This performs well from small screens including mobile devices to large desktops. To 
view the web portfolio one needs to open 'index.html' included within the folder 'framework'. 'index.html' uses 2 css files 'main.css' and 
'responsive.css'. Both the css files are included inside the 'css' subfolder of 'framework. Bootstrap grid layout is implemented with the 
'bootstrap.css' file indside the 'bootsrap/css' folder. The images and icons used in this project are included in 'framework/images' folder.

# The way it works:

When index.html is opened in the web browser it shows the completed projects' image in 'Featured Work' section. pointing mouse over the pictures
shows project name, details button and a github link to that code as a hover effect. Clicking on 'Details' button will create a modal window 
over the current one with details of this project. At the bottom of the modal window there is a 'Close' button to close it and getting back to
the original portfolio window. At the bottom of the page there is a section to contact me which includes my email address and link to my Github
and LinkedIn account.
